# QCA- Quaue control application

A smart and useful Flutter project.

Our proposal aims to address organization's service delivery process by leveraging my expertise and experience in implementing automated queue management solution. my main focus is on reducing customer waiting time, unnecessary abuse and improve service delivery quality of the organization. 

The project encompasses the following key objectives:

    ● Objective 1: Avoiding unnecessary customer waiting time
    ● Objective 2: Reducing unnecessary money expense and energy wastage
    ● Objective 3: Improve service delivery quality of the organization
    ● Objective 4: Reducing activities that encourage situations to bribery
    ● Objective 5: Enhance customer satisfaction

It has the following characteristics:

    Arrival Process: As the name suggests an arrival process look at different components of customer arrival. Customer arrival could in single, batch or bulk, arrival as distribution of time, arrival in finite population or infinite population.
    
    Service Mechanism: this looks at available resources along with the organization for customer service, queue structure to avail the service and pre-emption of service. Underlining assumption
    here is that service time of customers is independent of arrival to the queue.
    
    Queue Characteristics: this looks at selection of customers from the queue for service. Generally, customer selection is through first come first served method. As a result, customers leave if the
    queue is long, customer leave if they have waited too long or switch to faster serving queue.
